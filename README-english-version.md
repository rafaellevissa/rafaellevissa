### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rafael Levi - I'm a Full Stack developer with over 10 years of market experience.

## Brief history:
I've always worked with technology. As a teenager, I worked with computer maintenance between 2004 and 2009, and took basic computer courses such as Windows, Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, computer maintenance, and networking. I entered university (Federal University of Bahia) in 2009 and in 2011 I interned as a software developer, using Lotus Script and Java EE. In 2012, I was a substitute professor at the Federal University of Bahia in Technology and Calculus courses. In 2011, I got my CISCO certification and started studying Cloud infrastructure with AWS and GCP. Between 2012 and 2017, I taught at UFBa, SENAI, and other technical courses in infrastructure and software development, and did some professional projects mainly using PHP and Laravel. In 2017, I began a career transition from teacher to developer and started working on a Software project in a padlock factory that involved IoT, Electronics, Networks, Raspberry Pi, Python, and other technologies. I started a Master's degree in Computational Modeling at SENAI Cimatec and finished in 2020. From 2017 until today, I have developed and participated in various Web development projects with technologies such as: NodeJS, ReactJS, PHP, Python, Golang, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes. I have international certifications from AWS, Hashicorp Terraform, Harvard CS50.

## [By technologies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AxNHBtNAufnbei5YVt1XnSVmtTqxHkIK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108286114865654384665&rtpof=true&sd=true):
### Python:
- Experience: I started programming in Python with embedded systems more than 10 years ago, initially focusing on teaching and small automation projects, but since 2017 I started applying it to large-scale projects and professionally with the use of Web frameworks like Flask and Django. I have more than 10 years of experience with Python, but with the use of Flask and Django frameworks about 4 years.

### Javascript/Typescript:
- Experience: I started working with Javascript for building websites and small web systems more than 10 years ago. Throughout my years of experience working as a developer, there has always been JS in almost all projects, either using ReactJS or VueJS with about 4 years of experience or NodeJS on the back-end with about 5 years of experience. Regarding Typescript, I have about 4 years of experience.

### GoLang:
- Experience: In recent years, I have dedicated myself to some projects that had at least one microservice or more in Golang, using it in microservices architectures, building Rest APIs, gRPC, Websockets. I have accumulated about 3 years of experience.

### Devops:
- Experience: In all the projects I participated in, I was responsible not only for the code but also for the infrastructure, including Cloud Services such as AWS, GCP, messaging services like Kafka, SQS, RabbitMQ, Pipeline and CI/CD process, containerization with Docker and in some cases IaC (Infrastructure as Code) including Terraform and AWS CDK. I have more than 10 years of experience with most of these technologies.

### Note:
- In most of the projects and experience times mentioned above, there was an intersection between the accounted times. For example, in projects where I worked with Devops, I was usually also responsible for coding in a particular programming language, as well as in some projects there were services in more than one different language, to which I contributed.
